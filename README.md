So_Long was developed as a part of the curriculum at HIVE Helsinki, a coding school affiliated with the 42 network of coding schools headquartered in Paris.

My project successfully passed evaluation by three human evaluators, achieving the final score of 100 points.


PAC-GHOST was written on a Linux computer, so not sure how well it will run on Mac or Windows.

To run it, copy all the files to a directore and once inside it, run "make".

THe MLX42 library will be cloned in the process.

To run:

./so_long maps/mapfile.ber
